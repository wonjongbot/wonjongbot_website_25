This doesn&rsquo;t mean exception is necessarily &ldquo;unexpected&rdquo;; exception simply means operation deviates from the normal flow of execution.</p><p>Exceptions are synchronized (happens within the program flow). When an exception is generated, the processor jumps to the specific assembly linkage (see <a href=##context-switchassembly-linkages>Assembly Linkages</a>), which in turn calls the unified exception handler.</p><p>Then, the handler will display the error message, debug information. <em>(In a modern kernel, signal is sent to the process if the exception is recoverable, but signal is not supported in our OS)</em>. If no handler was installed, the default behavior is killing the offending process.</p><p>If an exception is detected in kernel mode, the exception is non-recoverable and Kernal will halt. The host machine to be restarted.</p><h3 id=interruptinterrupt-handlers>Interrupt/Interrupt Handlers</h3><p>An interrupt happens when a piece of hardware needs processor&rsquo;s attention, such as keyboard input, RTC, and PIC. Such operation is expected/unpredictable in the Kernel&rsquo;s/program flow&rsquo;s point of view.</p><p>The OS only contains essential drivers (see <a href=#supported-devicesdrivers>Supported Devices/Drivers</a>). Interrupt lines (IRQs) are masked and ignored.</p><p>The IRQ lines are managed by two i8259 PICs just like any other mainstream IBM-compatible PC.</p><p>Interrupts are asynchronous. When an interrupt is raised and processor is alerted, the kernel jumps to the specific assembly linkage (see <a href=##context-switchassembly-linkages>Assembly Linkages</a>).</p><p>The interrupt assmebly linkage pushes information and calls an unified interrupt handler.</p><p>Then, the handler will call the corresponding driver, and the driver will handle the remaining work (again, see <a href=#supported-devicesdrivers>Supported Devices/Drivers</a>).</p><h3 id=supported-devicesdrivers>Supported Devices/Drivers</h3><p>The 391OS-36 has drivers for the standard keyboard, Programmable Interval Timer (PIT), Real-Time Clock (RTC), and terminal.</p><p>Keyboard, PIT, and RTC drivers are for real devices and contains handlers for their interrupts (see <a href=#interruptinterrupt-handlers>Interrupt/Interrupt Handlers</a>).</p><p>The standard keyboard driver is responsible for servicing key presses. Uppercase/lowercase typing and combinational key handling is also supported.</p><p>The PIT and RTC all generates interrupts periodically.</p><p>The PIT and its driver are used to handle the scheduling and can be turned off (see <a href=#process-switchingscheduler>Process Switching/Scheduler</a>). It is only accessible by the kernel itself.</p><p>The RTC is user-level accessible and it is &ldquo;virtualized&rdquo; for each process by the RTC driver, so they all have its own instance and frenquency.</p><p><em>Above is why PIT us used for task scheduling. You don&rsquo;t want an user program to tamper with the scheduler frequency.</em></p><p>The terminal driver is for stdio operations, and works as a bridge that connects user/devices to the terminal/kernel.</p><p>There are three terminals(see <a href=#background-switchingmultiterminals>Background Switching/Multiterminals</a>). The input buffer for each terminal is limited to 128-characters.</p><h3 id=memory-addressing>Memory Addressing</h3><p>The kernel bypasses segmentation just like any mainstream modern operation systems.</p><p>Only paging was used for the memory addressing.</p><p>The memory layout is fixed (see <a href=#physical-memory-layout>Physical Memory Layout</a> and <a href=#virtual-memory-layout>Virtual Memory Layout</a>).</p><h3 id=physical-memory-layout>Physical Memory Layout</h3><p>From low to high, the kernel utilizes the following 32MB physical memory:</p><ul><li>4MB space with five 4KB space for the VRAM for the active terminal, 3 terminal backups, and an extra backup space (see <a href=#background-switchingmultiterminals>Multiterminals</a>)</li><li>4MB space for the kernel data (mostly Process Control Blocks (PCBs) and Terminal Info (TI) blocks) and kernel stack (see <a href=#process-controlexecutehalt>Process Control</a> and <a href=#background-switchingmultiterminals>Multiterminals</a>)</li><li>Six 4MB spaces for user applications&rsquo; binary and stack (see <a href=#process-controlexecutehalt>Process Control</a>)</li></ul><h3 id=virtual-memory-layout>Virtual Memory Layout</h3><p>From low to high, the kernel has mapped the 4GB virtual memory space for each user program:</p><ul><li>4MB managed by a superviser Page Table (PT), with five 4KB superviser pages, going through from the physical memory (see <a href=#physical-memory-layout>Physical Memory Layout</a>)</li><li>4MB superviser jumbo page for the kernel, going through from the physical memory (see <a href=#physical-memory-layout>Physical Memory Layout</a>)</li><li>4MB user page at address address 128MB, for the current running program only (see <a href=#process-controlexecutehalt>Process Control</a>)</li><li>4MB managed by a user PT, with a 4KB vidmap page for the current active program, controlled by the vidmap (see <a href=#system-calls>System Calls</a> and <a href=#background-switchingmultiterminals>Multiterminals</a>)</li></ul><h3 id=system-calls>System Calls</h3><table><thead><tr><th>System Call</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>halt</td><td>Halt the current program (process).

It is extracted during the execute system call.</td></tr><tr><td>vidmap</td><td>Giving the user-level access to the current VRAM by mapping it to the vidmap page, which is user-level accessible.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>System calls are generated deliberately by user programs by generating a &ldquo;soft interrupt,&rdquo; INT x80 on x86 systems.</p><p>When a system call was generated, the processor jumps to the system call assembly linkage (see <a href=##context-switchassembly-linkages>Context Switch/Assembly Linkages</a>).</p><p>Arguments for system calls are carried by %EAX, %EBX, %ECX, and %EDX registers.<br>The linkage will check if the arguments are valid, and then hand the job to the corresponding system call handler.</p><h3 id=process-controlexecutehalt>Process Control/Execute/Halt</h3><p>The kernel supports up to 6 processes. In the kernel space, each process holds a kernel stack and a <strong>Process Control Block (PCB)</strong>.</p><p>In the user space, each process holds their own user page (see <a href=#virtual-memory-layout>Virtual Memory Layout</a>) which contains the executable binary and a user stack.</p><p>By having their own kernel and user stacks, their hardware context and user stack data won&rsquo;t be overwritten by other programs.</p><p>Each PCB tracks the allocated process ID (PID), parent PID, terminal ID, kernel/user stacks, FD, etc.</p><p>When <strong>creating a new process (execute system call, see <a href=#system-calls>System Calls</a>)</strong>, the OS first runs sanity check, extracts the program name and argument.</p><p>PCB is allocated, user page is created, program binary is copied, FDs are initialized, bookkeeping is done (to retrun to parent process upon exit).</p><p>Finally, it will switch the kernel stack, build a custom hardware context with the new PC and user stack, and return to the linkage for context switch(see <a href=##context-switchassembly-linkages>Assembly Linkages</a>).</p><p>When <strong>a process is halted (halt system call, see <a href=#system-calls>System Calls</a>)</strong>, the OS will free the resources, tearing down the user page, vidmap, and FD.</p><p>Then, the allocated PCB block is freed, restore the context of the parent process&rsquo; information and return to the linkage.</p><h3 id=process-switchingscheduler>Process Switching/Scheduler</h3><p>The kernel supports a round-robin scheduler, prompted by the PIT interrupt (see <a href=#supported-devicesdrivers>Supported Devices/Drivers</a>).</p><p>While 6 processes are supported, only 3 of them are scheduled, and 1 at a time is actually being executed (other 2 processes are paused until it is unfrozen by the scheduler).</p><p>The scheduler schedules 3 processes that is shown on each terminal (active process), constantly switching and is able to be multitasked.</p><p>But only one program is &ldquo;actually&rdquo; running (running process), as this is a kernel that only accounts for a uniprocessor system.</p><p>The <strong>program switching</strong> begins in the kernel with the hardware context saved. It is pretty much like a halt call, but it will preserve the current resources and context.</p><p>Then, kernel page and stack, and context are switch to the next scheduled process&rsquo;s information. Kernel then returns to the linkage (see <a href=##context-switchassembly-linkages>Assembly Linkages</a>).</p><h3 id=background-switchingmultiterminals>Background Switching/Multiterminals</h3><p>The OS supports up to 3 (active) terminals. Each terminal tracks the current active program, PCB pointer, coordinations, etc. Scheduler relies on these information to properly function.</p><p>When <strong>active process is switched in the background</strong>, a lot of extra works needs to be done. One of the big needs is to switching to with separate VRAMs.</p><p>The running process cannot print to user display when it is not active. The kernel handles this is by having 5 individual VRAM pages (see <a href=#physical-memory-layout>Physical Memory Layout</a>) and switching the page mapping based on the current running process.</p><p>When a <strong>running terminal is being serviced</strong>, the kernel will backup the previous processes&rsquo;s VRAM to its VRAM page, copy the corresponding VRAM to the display, and remap the vidmap.</p><hr><p>I was able to write this Technical Overview thanks to Peizhe&rsquo;s help (<a href=https://os.paizhang.info/>website</a>)</p><div class=footer>Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a> with
